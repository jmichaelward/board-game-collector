# Board Game Collector - A WordPress Plugin
Board Game Collector is a custom WordPress plugin that connects to the
BoardGameGeek API. It retrieves information about a user's game collection,
creates or updates a related custom post type in the database, saves its
metadata, and attaches the box art as a featured image.

This plugin is being developed as part of a weekly board game night app,
and is being used as an exploration in the WordPress REST API, which is
native in WordPress as of version 4.7.
